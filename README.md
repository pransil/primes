This is a test project to try out Claude Code using mdc files to guide Claude through the process of creating an app. I started with 3 files from snarktank/ai-dev-tasks and made a few changes. I believe the files were originally intended to work inside Cursor, the VSCode fork that has good AI features. I wanted to see how well these would work with Claude Code. They worked very well. Obviously the project is trivial but that is not the point here. :-)
