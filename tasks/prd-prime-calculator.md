# Product Requirements Document: Prime Number Calculator

## Introduction/Overview

The Prime Number Calculator is a command-line Python application that helps users discover prime numbers up to a specified limit. The application provides an interactive, user-friendly interface for calculating and displaying prime numbers, with input validation and the ability to perform multiple calculations in a single session.

**Goal:** Create a simple, reliable tool for calculating prime numbers that prioritizes code readability and user experience over performance optimization.

## Goals

1. Provide an intuitive command-line interface for prime number calculation
2. Ensure robust input validation with helpful error messages
3. Display results in a clear, formatted manner
4. Allow users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the application
5. Handle edge cases gracefully (inputs 0, 1, 2)

## User Stories

- **As a student**, I want to quickly find all prime numbers up to a given limit so that I can verify my math homework.
- **As a developer**, I want a simple tool to generate prime numbers for testing algorithms so that I can use known prime sequences.
- **As a math enthusiast**, I want to explore prime number patterns by trying different upper limits so that I can satisfy my curiosity about number theory.

## Functional Requirements

1. The application must prompt the user with: "I will calculate prime numbers for you. How high should I go?"
2. The system must validate that user input is a numeric value
3. If invalid input is provided, the system must display an error message and re-prompt for input
4. The system must set an upper limit of 10,000 for performance reasons
5. The system must calculate all prime numbers less than or equal to the specified number using any readable algorithm
6. The system must display results in the format: "Prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..."
7. For inputs 0 or 1, the system must display "No prime numbers found up to [number]"
8. For input 2, the system must display "Prime numbers: 2"
9. After displaying results, the system must ask "Do you want to calculate again? (Y/N)"
10. The system must treat any response other than "Y" or "y" as "no" and terminate
11. If the user responds with "Y" or "y", the system must return to step 1

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Advanced algorithm optimization (Sieve of Eratosthenes not required)
- Graphical user interface
- File input/output capabilities
- Parallel processing or multi-threading
- Prime factorization or other mathematical operations
- Support for extremely large numbers (>10,000)
- Persistence of calculation history

## Technical Considerations

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Dependencies:** Standard library only (no external packages required)
- **File structure:** Single file application (`primes.py`)
- **Input validation:** Use try/except blocks for numeric conversion
- **Algorithm:** Simple trial division acceptable for readability
- **Testing:** Should be testable with unit tests for core functions

## Success Metrics

- Application handles all specified input types without crashing
- Error messages are clear and actionable
- Results are displayed correctly for all test cases (0, 1, 2, 10, 100, 1000)
- User can perform multiple calculations in a single session
- Code is readable and maintainable by junior developers

## Open Questions

- Should the application display the count of prime numbers found?
- Is there a preference for specific error message wording?
- Should the application handle keyboard interrupts (Ctrl+C) gracefully?
