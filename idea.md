The goal is to build a python applicaton, primes.py that
1. Prompts the user with: "I will calculate prime numbers for you. How high should I go?"
2. When the user gives a response, check to make sure it is a number, then calculate all prime numbers that are less than or equal to that number. 
3. Return the list to the user.
4. Ask if they want to do it again, (Y/N)
5. If they respond Y, go back to step 1. Otherwise terminate.
